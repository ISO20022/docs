# PEPPOL - Making procurement better

* [Release Management](https://github.com/ISO20022/iso20022-docs-peppol/blob/master/release-management/main.adoc)

[PEPPOL](http://peppol.eu/) enables businesses across Europe to communicate electronically with public buyers in various stages of the procurement process, it utilises [ISO20022](https://www.iso20022.org/payments_dashboard.page) payment messages for this service and the [following Banks](https://vefa.difi.no/iso20022/) are part of this agreement.

PEPPOL enables trading partners to exchange standards-based electronic documents over the PEPPOL network (based on a 4-corner model). These documents include e-Orders, e-Advance Shipping Notes, eInvoices, eCatalogues, Message Level Responses, etc.

[PEPPOL](http://peppol.eu/) 

* is a set of artifacts and specifications enabling cross-border eProcurement. The use of PEPPOL is governed by a multi-lateral agreement structure which is owned and maintained by OpenPEPPOL.

* is not an e-Procurement platform but instead provides a set of technical specifications that can be implemented in existing eProcurement solutions and eBusiness exchange services to make them interoperable between disparate systems across Europe.


PEPPOL Access Points connect users to the PEPPOL network and exchange electronic documents based on the PEPPOL specifications. Buyers and suppliers are free to choose their preferred single Access Point provider to connect to all PEPPOL participants already on the network. (‘Connect once, connect to all’).
